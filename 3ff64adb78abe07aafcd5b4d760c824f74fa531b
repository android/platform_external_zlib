      "message": "Yes, that is right!\n\nAfter the recent patches I\u0027ve landed, we have 96% of decompression code coverage (i.e. lines) and around 61% for compression (https://analysis.chromium.org/p/chromium/coverage/dir?host\u003dchromium.googlesource.com\u0026project\u003dchromium/src\u0026ref\u003drefs/heads/master\u0026revision\u003dc0d9d594106de411244a0fd742da6a26df40298a\u0026path\u003d//third_party/zlib/contrib/optimizations/\u0026platform\u003dlinux).\n\nI hope to improve that compression number as soon I manage to enable a last test (i.e. cover_trees).\n\nConcerning the headers: if AOSP has gtest available somewhere, maybe we could simply add a conditional for the correct paths for the headers?\n\nSomething like:\n\n#ifdef AOSP_BUILD_NO_CHROMIUM\n// proper paths to the headers needed\n#else\n// current code\n#endif",
