But we probably want to add METADATA so it can be updated with external_updater? Is that even possible with the way Chromium\u0027s zlib is set up? I see a repo at https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/zlib/, though it looks like it\u0027s also part of the main Chromium repository: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/master/third_party/zlib/. They do look to be in sync somehow. The zlib specific one doesn\u0027t have tags, so I guess we\u0027ll need to add that in order to use the external_updater?",
